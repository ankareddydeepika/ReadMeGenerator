  # README Generator
  ## Description 
 
As a developer I want a README generator so that I can easily put together a good README for a new project. A command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.
